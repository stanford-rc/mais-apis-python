# This script takes the current version number (from the VERSION file,
# containing a valid Public version identifier), and turns it into a
# Developmental release.  It is meant to be run prior to uploading to Test
# PyPi, so that the version uploaded is unique, and is also 'earlier' (in
# version-numbering terms) than the public version identifier.

# For more information about version numbering, see
# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/
