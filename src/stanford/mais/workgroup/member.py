class WorkgroupMembership:
    """Holds the sets of workgroup members or administrators.

    Each :class:`~stanford.mais.workgroup.Workgroup` includes two instances of
    this class, accessible through the following properties:

    * :meth:`~stanford.mais.workgroup.Workgroup.members` provides access to the
      sets of workgroup members.  As a reminder, this the *real* list of
      workgroup members, without filtering.  See
      :class:`~stanford.mais.workgroup.properties.WorkgroupFilter` for details.

    * :meth:`~stanford.mais.workgroup.Workgroup.administrators` provides access
      to the sets of workgroup administrators.

    Within this class, the members (or administrators) are divided into three
    categories, each of which has its own property accessor:

    * :meth:`people` provides access to the set of members who are people.  The
      values stored are SUNetIDs, and the type is
      :class:`WorkgroupMembershipPersonContainer`.

    * :meth:`workgroups` provides access to the set of nested workgroups.  The
      values stored are fully-qualified workgroup names (in the typical
      'stem:name' form), and the type is
      :class:`WorkgroupMembershipWorkgroupContainer`.

    * :meth:`certificates` provides access to the set of certificates.  The
      values stored are certificate subject common names (CNs), and the type is
      :class:`WorkgroupMembershipCertificateContainer`.

    .. warning::
        If the workgroup's visibility is set to ``PRIVATE``, and you are not an
        administrator of the workgroup, then all workgroup member and
        administrator sets will appear empty.

    Finally, this class supports using :func:`len` to find out the total number
    of workgroup members (or administrators).
