    check status.

    This takes a list of SUNetIDs, and returns a list of SUNetIDs which have
    been checked against the Accounts API for both activity and service level.
    The returned result shows which SUNetIDs are active full (or
    full-sponsored), active base (or base-sponsored), or inactive.

    and/or any kind of whitespace.  If the input is some other form of
    collection (list, tuple, or set), the function assumes that all whitespace
    etc. have been removed.

    This is designed to catch most exceptions.  Exceptions related to
    validation (for example, attempting to validate an obviously-invalid
    SUNetID like `ab$#`) will result in the 'SUNetID' being added to the
    `unknown` list, instead of throwing an exception.  The only exceptions that
    should be expected from this function are ones related to API issues.

    :param raw: The list of SUNetIDs.  If a `str`, then the list may be comma- and/or whitespace-separated.

    :param client: An :class:`~stanford.mais.account.AccountClient` to connect to the Account API.

    :return: The results of the validation.  See the definition of :class:`~nero_wgcreator.account.validate.AccountValidationResults` for details.  If the input to this function is a string; that string will be in `raw`, and the parsed list will be in `raw_set`.  If the input to this function is not a string, then `raw` will be `None` and `raw_set` will be a copy of the input.
