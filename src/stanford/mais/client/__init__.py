    The :class:`MAISClient` is the first thing you will instantiate when you
    want to interact with a MaIS API.

    To instantiate a :class:`MAISClient`, you will need to provide two pieces
    of configuration as parameters to the class constructor.  The configuration
    items are documented below.

    For convenience, you may wish to use one of the ready-made constructors,
    :meth:`MAISClient.prod` and :meth:`MAISClient.uat`.  If you use one of
    those, you need only provide a client certificate path.
