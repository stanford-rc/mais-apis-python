    """
    The :class:`MAISClient` is the first thing you will instantiate when you
    want to interact with a MaIS API.

    To instantiate a :class:`MAISClient`, you will need to provide two pieces
    of configuration as parameters to the class constructor.  The configuration
    items are documented below.

    For convenience, you may wish to use one of the ready-made constructors,
    :meth:`MAISClient.prod` and :meth:`MAISClient.uat`.  If you use one of
    those, you need only provide a client certificate path.
    """

    urls: Mapping[str, str]
    """A mapping of API to URL.

    This mapping uses API names (like ``account``) as keys, and the base URL as
    the value.

    If you are setting up your own client instance, you will need to provide
    entries for each API you plan on using.  If you are using the UAT or PROD
    (production) environments, you can call :meth:`uat` or :meth:`prod`.  If
    you are using a different environment, or developing a MaIS API locally,
    you won't be able to use those methods, but you can study the code (more
    specifically, the URLs they embed) to get an idea of which URL is needed
    for which service.

    private key followed by a certificate.  The latter format (combined key and
    cert) was common in the old days; the former format (separate key and cert)
    is preferred today.

    The certificate (and key, if included) must be in PEM format (the text
    format).  If a key is included, and it is an EC key, then any necessary EC
    parameters may be included before the private key.

    this must be set to `None`.

    The file must be in PEM format (the text format), and must contain a single
